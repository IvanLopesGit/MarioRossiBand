          Mario Rossi is a Brazilian guitarist and singer based on São Bernardo
          do Campo
          <br /> (São Paulo State/Brazil). He has been moving forward in music
          since 2004,
          <br /> when he was 18 years old and made his live debut. Nowadays, as
          a confident player,
          <br /> he treats riffs, licks and melodies with respect and wisdom.
          <br /> He knows where he wants to go! <br />
          The guitarist/singer started his journey improving his skills as a
          cover artist.
          <br /> Classic songs like ‘Key to the Highway’ or Guitar Slim’s ‘The
          Things That I Used to Do’
          <br /> were some of the gems in his concerts. In addition, he played
          Elmore James,
          <br /> B.B. King, Peter Green, Johnny Winter, Eric Clapton, and also
          Ray Charles’s
          <br /> ‘Come Back Baby’ or Peter Green’s ‘Fallin’ Apart’.
          <br /> Mario Rossi had two unique experiences: in 2013 and then 2015,
          <br /> he joined the band that accompanied the American bluesman John
          Primer in Brazil.
          <br /> They played in cities in the South and Southeast of the
          country,
          <br />
          including a performance on The Noite com Danilo Gentili TV show,
          <br />
          screened by the channel SBT – one of the biggest TV channels in
          Brazil.
          <br />
          The final balance of all of that brought a permanent framework.
          <br /> In the USA, Mario Rossi toured in recent years.
          <br /> He jammed with NY Blues Hall of Fame members, and played guitar
          live
          <br /> at the Red Lion Club (Greenwich Village) with a bunch of good
          ones:
          <br /> David Bennett Cohen (keyboards, Country Joe &amp; The Fish),
          <br /> Arthur Nielson (guitar, Cyndi Lauper/Shemekia Copeland),
          <br /> Sonny Hudson (harmonica), and Mike Muller
          <br /> (bass, Albert King, Luther Allison and The Ramones).
          <br /> On November 1st, 2019, the Brazilian guitarist and singer
          released
          <br /> the first studio album of his own band, Mario Rossi Band.
          <br />
          &#39;Electric Art&#39; is a nice Rock and Blues piece of work.
          <br /> It has 8 new original tracks, with a beautiful vintage guitar
          tone.
          <br /> The album takes us to golden ages of music
          <br /> (something that’s not seen too much nowadays).
          <br /> Less than one year later, on September 18th, 2020, Mario Rossi
          Band
          <br /> released a new studio album, &#39;The Same Old Street&#39;.
          <br /> It’s an intense 10-track journey through Classic and Blues
          Rock.
          <br />
          The songs are all original ones and give us a good taste of his
          arsenal of riffs and licks
          <br /> inspired by some of the great rockers from the 60’s and the
          70’s.
          <br />
          The record is a natural step from &#39;Electric Art&#39;,
          <br /> and shows that definitely Brazil isn’t only the Bossa Nova and
          Samba land.
